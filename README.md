## Problem we like to solve

Our busy lifestyles means birthdays/events are so hard to remember. People not using Facebook as much and with Facebook having stopped everyone using their API to see birthdays etc makes it even more difficult to remember birthdays/events.

## Solution

An app where you can log events and receive automated notifications regarding upcoming events.

### DAY 1Ô∏è‚É£

- [x] - Create user stories
- [x] - Create user journey
- [x] - Planned mvp user journey 
- [x] -Set up file architecture


### DAY 2Ô∏è‚É£

- [x] - Supertest with jest

### Challenges we faced

- setting up travis properly requires a test script for travis to execute

"test": "jest" vs "test": "jest --watch all"

Things we Discovered:

- caching our dependencies in .travis.yml file >>> cache: npm
 this sped up travis' build process

### Other problems we had
* last minute commit issue (learnt how to back track on commits)
* passport.js (we may need more time to play with it to fully understand it)
* front end validation through dom.js to check passowrds (decided to just send it to the back and check it there)
* time constraints to reach stretch goals (such as filtering events)


### Things Learnt

- Estimation
- MVP (core app functionality add user, event list, contact page etc)
- Service Workers
